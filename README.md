# ELIXIR-UK Fellowship
The ELIXIR-UK Fellowship aims to embed Research Data Management (RDM) know-how into UK universities and institutes. Data steward Fellows will create training materials and deliver local training. We look to support Fellows’ RDM training activities and efforts to build a community of practice within their host institutions. 


## Contribute
If you want to contribute to our training materials, we encourage you to apply to become an ELIXIR-UK Fellow when the next application round opens.

The ELIXIR Fellowship is part of a broader project with the ambitious goal of supporting the life sciences UK workforce in research data management and professionalising the role of Data Stewards.
This Fellowship of data steward ambassadors lies at the project’s core and drives the main goals and achievements.
