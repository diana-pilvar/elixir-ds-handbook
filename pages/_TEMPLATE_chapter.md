# [Topic]
Last updated: [D Month, Year]

[should contain: relevance/important in generic sense + what do you get out of the chapter - max 6 sentences] 

## Content
1. [Keywords](#keywords)
2. [Context](#context)
3. [Models](#models)
4. [Cheatsheet](#cheatsheet)
5. [Community examples](#community-examples)

## Keywords
[keywords separated by commas]

## Context
[part 1 - background - what do you need to know to read the info below - history, recent developments]
[part 2- extra info/deepdive on importance/relevance, impact for broader society -  how does what you learn here impact your work as data steward] 

## Models
[What should go here: Successfully established/well-used and applied, published examples, like an article - criteria: should be practically applicable so we can make it into thingies in the cheatsheet]
[What should we do with it, in the text: Explain theory, goal behind and practical step/how applied models - max 10 sentences with links and clear substructure/header]
[Structure idea:
  Model 1 title
  Foundations
  Goal
  Practical application]
[If possible: graphical representation - RDMkit tool assemblies example to structure]

Discussion: what if there is no model? Challenging as there is a relation between model and cheatsheet + if no model than maybe having a chapter in the handbook doesn’t make sense]

## Cheatsheet
[Pointers for writing this section:
* The cheatsheet section should contain tips, tricks, do’s and dont’s
* Aim is to help readers apply the topic and models in their context
* Level of granularity: very generic, with applying the steps of the models, if possible with links [more granularity can be found in next section of best practices]
* Example for this chapter: The cheatsheet should focus on general categories like meeting preparation, clear structure, etc. Tips will be applied, and links to community or best practices like agenda, rotating chairs, meeting notes etc. will be added in the best practices section
* Add external links for each tip. Loosely, but if a tip aligns with a specific model or step, make the connection. Links should reference higher-level models or steps, not specific community or best practices, which will be covered in the next section.]
