On these pages, you will find training materials to deliver workshops, short courses or interactive sessions. The combined knowledge and experience of several Fellows and other project collaborators build the foundations of these materials. As such, you will also be able to rewatch the delivery of these short-training courses and review the average engagement rate achieved.
You will also find links to download slide decks and other resources and tools that have been previously tested to deliver maximum attendee engagement.
